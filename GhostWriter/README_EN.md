Ghost Writer is a personal note and document offline management application developed based on MrDoc. It is a purely frontend project that utilizes a local sqlite database. With the exception of external resources such as images, videos, links, and the OCR recognition interface used for self-editing, the registration, login, and editing functions do not require an internet connection. All data is stored locally within the application's resource folder, ensuring complete privacy and security. The default administrator account is "admin" with the password "admin123.."
