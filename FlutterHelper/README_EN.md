Flutter Helper is a frontend project developed using Vue. It is a low-code development tool for mobile applications based on Flutter, GetX, and sqlite. Users can create forms and form details, which will generate corresponding Flutter sqlite code (including database initialization and CRUD operations) and generate related page code for each form (using the GetX structure). This tool facilitates and expedites the implementation of various development requirements.
